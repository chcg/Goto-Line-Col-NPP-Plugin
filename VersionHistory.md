## Version History

### Version 1.2.0.0
#### Enhancements:
1. Realtime display of ANSI and UTF-8 byte info, at a fixed UI spot, on the plugin panel. That means, no need for repetitive clicking of the Goto button, and viewing this info within a calltip that jumps around the screen.

### Version 1.1.0.0
#### Enhancements:
1. Added UTF-8 byte sequence and Unicode code point display in the calltip.
2. Added *Char Column* and *Byte Column* display in the calltip.
3. In the Preferences dialog, replaced option *'Expand TABS for column value computation (Unchecked)'* with *'Use byte count for column value computation (Checked)'*.
4. Added spin controls on the Line and Column input fields for quick navigation to adjacent line or column.

#### Fixed Issue:
1. The calltip was getting displayed only after clicking the *Go* button twice.

### Version 1.0.0.1
1. Increased Line and Column input fields to accept up to 8 digits.
