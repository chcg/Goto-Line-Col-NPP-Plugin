# Goto-Line-Col-NPP-Plugin
A Notepad++ plugin for navigating to a specified line and column position in a file. It can be very handy while manually inspecting data in fixed-width format files.

After navigating to the specified position, the plugin also displays the hex code of the character at that position. This can be handy to check, say if a character is  (ASCII 9) instead of regular SPACE (ASCII 32).
